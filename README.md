- `FloatingActionButton` position on pre-Lollipop devices is a bit messed up.
- Tests for TweetsActivity and CreateTweetActivity are not done.
- CreateTweetActivity doesn't show any feedback when creating a new tweet.
- When tweet is created, it shows time "in 2 seconds" or something similar.

- There's most likely a bunch of styles, theme attributes and some utility methods/classes that are not actually used. Didn't have time to cleanup.
- No comments, but code should be the documentaion.
